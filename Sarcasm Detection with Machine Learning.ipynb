    "Sarcasm has been part of our language for many years. It means being the opposite of what you mean, usually with a distinct tone of voice in a fun way. If you think that anyone can understand sarcasm, then you are wrong, because understanding sarcasm depends on your language skills and your knowledge of other people’s minds. But what about a computer? Is it possible to train a machine learning model that can detect whether a sentence is sarcastic or not? Yes, it is!"

Today, it is also used in news headlines and various other social media platforms to gain more attention. Sarcasm detection is a natural language processing and binary classification task. We can train a machine learning model to detect whether or not a sentence is sarcastic using a dataset of sarcastic and non-sarcastic sentences that I found on Kaggle."
