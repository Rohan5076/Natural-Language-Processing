For example, I can easily identify Hindi and English, but being an Indian, it is also not possible for me to identify all Indian languages. This is where the language identification task can be used. Google Translate is one of the most popular language translators in the world which is used by so many people around the world. It also includes a machine learning model to detect languages that you can use if you don’t know which language you want to translate."

The dataset that I am using is collected from Kaggle, which contains data about 22 popular languages and contains 1000 sentences in each of the languages, so it will be an appropriate dataset for training a language detection model with machine learning. So in the section below, I will take you through how you can train a language detection model with machine learning using Python."
