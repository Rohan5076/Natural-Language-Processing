    "There is a huge amount of data appearing digitally, so it is necessary to develop a unique procedure to immediately summarize long texts while keeping the main idea. Text summarization also makes it possible to shorten the reading time, speed up information searches and obtain as much information as possible on a subject.\n",

Multiple text summary descriptions are provided, for example, explained the report as text generated from one or more documents that communicate relevant knowledge in the first text, and that is no longer than half of the main text and generally much more limited than this."
